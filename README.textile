h1. Responsive email template

A table-based (but responsive) email template. Has MailChimp merge tags in place. Based on the following work:

* "From Monitor To Mobile: Optimizing Email Newsletters With CSS":http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/18/from-monitor-to-mobile-optimizing-email-newsletters-with-css/
* "Email Boilerplate":https://github.com/seanpowell/Email-Boilerplate
* "MailChimp Email Blueprints":https://github.com/mailchimp/Email-Blueprints

h2. Images

Some of the images used within this template are created at double-resolution to give a crisp display on HiDPI screens (such as iPhone4 onwards) - please bear in mind this will require extra bandwidth. If you are optimising for lower bandwidths you may want to use standard resolution images instead. Also, images hidden using @display:none;@ do still load, even though they are not displayed.

Make sure you link all your images using full URL paths, and upload them to a suitable webspace, or upload/link via your email transmission service.
